## Purpose of Software:
- CMSC 313 Homework #8, Matrix Library in C and C++

## Files:
- matrixlibrary.cpp: Matrix Library in C++
- program: Compiled C++ code in an executable
- matrixlib.c: Matrix Library in C
- cprogram: Compiled C code in an executable

## Build Instructions:
- For testing, I used g++ matrixlibrary.cpp -o program
- I had issues with gcc and found g++ worked when I specified the output
- Same with matrixlib.c

## Testing Methodology:
- The matrices from the homework assignment were defined and operated on
- I used g++ to compile both documents and test, the answer comes on screen when the program is finished

## Additional Information:
- I'm hoping that g++ is an acceptable way to compile the code and run it, it worked fine on my MacBook Air
